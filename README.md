### Project Overview:
Fungal endophytes are widespread symbionts of grasses that have been shown to provide a variety of context dependent benefits under environmental stress such as drought or salinity tolerance. Context-dependence may make interactions seem unpredictable as environmental conditions vary between years, but it provides a distinct mechanism by which symbionts may act as mutualists beyond influencing mean population growth rates. We are quantifying the relative importance of mean and variance effects of microbial symbionts using long-term demographic data from experimental plots in Indiana at Lilly-Dickey Woods. 

The experiment, started in 2007, comprises 10-18 plots for each of 7 species of grass hosts. Half the plots were planted with 20 endophyte-infected plants, and half with 20 endophyte-free plants. The plots are censused annually for plant survival, plant size (measured as number of tillers) and reproduction (measured as number of flowering tillers and measurements of seed and spikelets).

We estimate individual level vital rates from this experimental data. From these vital rate estimates, we build stochastic Integral Projection models to make population projections which allow us to assess the contributions of endophyte partnership on both the mean and variance components of host fitness.
