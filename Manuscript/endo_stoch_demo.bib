	abstract = {The boundary dynamics of a genetic model for an age-structured population in a temporally fluctuating environment are analyzed. The condition for invasion by a new allele identifies the logarithmic growth rate a of each life history phenotype as the fitness measure relevant to “r-selection.” An analytical formula is obtained for fitness a when temporal variance in life history characters is small. This formula reveals the major qualitative and quantitative effects of the average life history, fluctuations, and temporal autocorrelation on fitness. A similar approximation is obtained for the log-variance of population number so that the statistical distribution of population size can be estimated.},
